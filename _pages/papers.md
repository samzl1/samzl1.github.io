<p><strong><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4430334">COPPAcalypse? The Youtube Settlement's Impact on Kids Content</a> (with Garrett Johnson, Tesary Lin, and James Cooper). Revise & Resubmit, Management Science. </strong></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We examine the tradeoff between privacy and personalization for online content by evaluating the impact of YouTube's settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Under the settlement, YouTube removed all forms of personalization for child-directed content starting in January 2020, which included personalized ads and platform features like personalized search and recommendations. We study the resulting impact on 5,066 top American YouTube channels by comparing the child-directed content creators to their non-child-directed counterparts using a difference-in-differences design. On the supply side, we find that child-directed content creators produce 18% less content and pivot towards producing non-child-directed content. Child-directed content creators also invest less in content quality: the proportion of original content falls by 11% and manual captioning falls by 27%, while user content ratings fall by 10%. On the demand side, views of child-directed channels fall by 20%. Consistent with the platform's degraded capacity to match viewers to content, both content creation and content views become more concentrated among top child-directed YouTube channels.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Generalized and Simulated Method of Moments are often used to estimate
 structural Economic models. Yet, it is commonly reported that optimization
 is challenging because the corresponding objective function is non-convex. For
 smooth problems, this paper shows that convexity is not required: under a global
 rank condition involving the Jacobian of the sample moments, certain algorithms
 are globally convergent. These include a gradient-descent and a Gauss-Newton
 algorithm with appropriate choice of tuning parameters. The results are robust to
 1) non-convexity, 2) one-to-one non-linear reparameterizations, and 3) moderate
 misspecification. In contrast, Newton-Raphson and quasi-Newton methods can
 fail to converge because of non-convexity. The condition precludes non-global op
tima. Numerical and empirical examples illustrate the condition, non-convexity,
 and convergence properties of different optimizers.</p>
