Welcome to my website! 

My name is Liang Zhong, and I am an applied econometrician from Boston University. My research focuses on two main areas: the first area is to develop computationally efficient econometric tools, and the second area is to use economic theory and big data techniques to offer actionable policy insight. 

My job market paper bridges these areas by introducing an easy-to-implement method to address a critical policy-relevant question: how should we test for the existence and extent of interference, such as peer effects and spillover effects?

Beyond my job market paper, my research spans interdisciplinary applications, including 
<ul><li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14386" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> Optimization of Non-convex Objective Functions </a> <em>(R&R at Review of Economic Studies)</em> </li> 
<li> <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4430334" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank"> Personalization-Privacy Tradeoff in Digital Markets </a> <em> (R&R at Management Science) </em> </li> </ul> 

These works reflect my broader interest in Labor Economics, Digital Economics, and Microeconomic Theory.

I will be on the job market in AY 2024-2025 and available for interviews.
