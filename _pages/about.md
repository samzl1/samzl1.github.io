I am Liang Zhong, an applied econometrician from Boston University. My research focuses on two key areas: (1) developing computationally efficient econometric tools and (2) leveraging economic theory and big data techniques to generate actionable policy insights.

My job market paper bridges these areas by introducing an easy-to-implement method to address a critical policy-relevant question: how should we test for the existence and extent of interference, such as peer and spillover effects?

Beyond this, my broader research interests span Econometrics, Labor Economics, Digital Economics, and Microeconomic Theory.

I will be joining the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Business School as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics in Fall 2025.
